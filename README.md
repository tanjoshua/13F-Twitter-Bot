# 13F-Twitter-Bot
Every quarter, investment managers across the US managing over $100 million in assets have to declare their positions via a 13F filing. Although the declared positions are delayed by 3 months, people are still interested in what the most prominent hedge funds are invested in. This twitter bot programmatically selects the most significant position changes based on these 13F filings and tweets them out.

The bot is deployed at [@13FTracker](https://twitter.com/13FTracker) on Twitter. Check it out!

UPDATE (Q4 2022): Elon deemed my account to be in violation of twitter's policy and my api write permissions go revoked :( Hopefully one day this bot will be back up
